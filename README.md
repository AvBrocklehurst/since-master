# What's changed since Master

A little inprogess project for myself to learn angular 2. When completed, it should allow you to list which github repos you're interested in (public, or your own private) and display what commits have happened since the last merge to master.

This idea came about as a solution within my own company where higher ups didn't know what had been done since the app was last updated on the app store (which is when it was merged to master.)
